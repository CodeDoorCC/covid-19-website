Create a website that displays offers from people who are willing to help to fight Covid-19.

Your city needs your help. A lot of people are willing to help others during the Corona-Virus crisis. Some offer grocery shopping for elderly, some doctors offer drive through testing. Plan a site that displays all these offers. The marketing department has yet not given you a design and asks you to come up with your own site structure. 

Step 1: Start by building the HTML for the page.

You have set up the HTML structure of the Covid-19 page. Of course, it needs some styling. Write your own CSS styles to make your site look appealing to users. What colors should you chose? A site for a Covid-19 topic should have other colors than a page of Burger restaurant. Decide with your team which colors to choose, which font styles etc.

Step 2: Write a separate CSS file and apply the styles to the HTML page.

Your site looks nice, but it has little dynamic content on it. Get more resources by Covid-19 helpers through APIs of your interest. Maybe you can display content by HackerNews or Tweets regarding the topic. Find out how to use an API and show the data on your site. Also add the following feature for a hospital in your area: Imagine people show up to the reception that want to be tested. You have been hired to write a program that will register patients. Build an online form that asks for age, symptoms and pre-consisting conditions. 

Step 3: Write a Script in JavaScript that uses control flows to decide where to sent the patient after she has entered her data.

Its time to safe the data you are generating via the forms. Create a database and connect it to your Covid-19 page. Make sure its safe and that the data cannot be accessed by people not autorized. Build a statistics page that shows (without the names) the number of patients, the average age and the average amount of symptoms.

Step 4: Create a database and connect it to your Covid-19 page.
